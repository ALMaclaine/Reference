HTML Specification Content Types:
   - Metadata content:    Data that is not present on the page itself, but affects the page's presentation
                          or includes other information about the page.  This includes elements such as title, link, meta, and style.

   - Flow content:        This includes just about every element that’s used in the body of an HTML document, including elements such as 
                          header, footer, and even p. The only elements excluded are those that have no effect on the document’s flow:  script, link, and meta elements in the page’s head, for example.

   - Sectioning Content:  Elements on the page that group other elements into logical sections. In HTML5, this includes article, 
                          aside, nav, and section. Shortly, we’ll talk in more detail about sectioning content and how it can affect the way you write your markup.

   - Heading Content:     This type of content defines the header of a given section, and includes the various levels of heading 
                          (h1, h2, and so on).

   - Phrasing Content:    This category is roughly the equivalent to what you’re used to thinking of as inline content; it includes 
                          elements such as em, strong, cite, and the like.

   - Embedded Content:    This one’s fairly straightforward, and includes elements that are, well, embedded into a page, such as img, 
                          object, embed, video, and canvas.

   - Interactive Content: This category includes any content with which users can interact. It consists mainly of form elements, as well 
                          as links and other elements that are interactive only when certain attributes are present. Two examples in- clude the audio element when the controls attribute is present, and the input element with a type attribute set to anything but "hidden".
