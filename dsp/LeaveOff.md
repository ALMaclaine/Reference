Successfully made SquareOff which totally destroys a sound by making
every phase flip a square wave. Currently unipolar, needs to be fixed.

You made a hardcore transient shaper that sends all values over threshold to
whatever gain, makes fairly cool distorted sounds.

You should consider making SquareOff work on either or both polarities, with
different thresholds and distortion amounts.

Some things you should learn soon are how to properly scale values to decibals.
Also how to make a signal sum to mono.

You made a clipper which sounds really good. You figured out that FuzzPlus3
by audiodamage is just a soft sine like in ableton saturator.

You need to relearn calculus and figure out how to graph things well/easily.
The clincher for saturation/distortion is knowing how to graph things easily/well.
You can easily recreate FuzzPlus3, and Abletons saturator.
You will most likely be able to recreate circuit if you work at it.

Use chebychev polynomials to mimic the melda saturator.
